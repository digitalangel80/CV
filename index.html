      <p><em>Project Manager at <strong><a href="https://www.pokerstars.com">PokerStars</a></strong></em></p>

      <p>I have joined PokerStars in October 2020 as a Project Manager for the Social Gaming. I received my Bachelor Degree in Management in Germany but came back to Bulgaria and started working for HP for 4 years and this is how I entered the IT. And I like it ever since. I spent 2 years as PM for a German company and 2 years as a Scrum Master at SBTech (today known as DraftKings). I am coordinating and pushing the Team's efforts in meeting our goals and successfully completing and delivering our projects. I also try to reduce the stress for the guy on my left <- </p></td>
